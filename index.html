      <p class="hero-subtitle">
        A custom-built science and arts &amp; humanities portal designed just for Carson,
        based on real KAAC State questions, his strengths, and how his brain learns best.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>What this site does:</strong>  
        It doesn’t give you random facts. It gives you the <em>patterns</em> that KAAC loves:
        high-frequency topics, repeated clue styles, and early-buzz triggers – so you can think
        and buzz like a state-level player.

      <h2>Quick Start for Carson</h2>
      <p>
        There is no strict daily schedule here on purpose. This portal is organized by
        <strong>subjects</strong> and <strong>study themes</strong> so you can follow your focus
        and still work on what matters most for KAAC.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start in Chemistry → Foundations.</strong> Chemistry is about 40% of KAAC Science.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer in Buzzer Training.</strong> Use the strategy and buzzing pages to train your early-buzz instincts.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore Physics, Earth &amp; Space, Biology, and A/H.</strong> Use hubs and topic pages when you’re ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Come back to topics.</strong> There’s no “falling behind” – just making progress.</li>

      <p>
        This portal assumes you are smart, fast, and wired differently. It’s not trying to slow you down with
        endless notes. It’s here to give you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High-yield topics instead of random ones</li>
        <li>Patterns and buzzwords instead of long lectures</li>
        <li>Short, focused pages instead of massive walls of text</li>
        <li>Tools you can revisit whenever you want, in any order</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is steady progress, early recognition, and confidence when the question starts.
